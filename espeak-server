firevox

Is anyone here using firevox?  I've been trying to get it working but
have run into some issues.  Before I send a load of information to the
list I thought I'd better ask to see if anyone might be willing and able
to help me work this out.

Thanks,
rdc

Re: Reading bookshare with emacspeak

I too have never been able to use the daisy reader either.  I used to
get that prompt and when I would start outline-mode explicitly first,
then that prompt would go away but I still couldn't get the thing to
work.  I got as far as loading the entire .xml file into w3 but I
couldn't navigate anyplace.  I asked around here several times in the
past and never got anywhere so I'm beginning to doube anyone has been
successful with the thing.  Good luck.

Reading bookshare with emacspeak

T.V. Raman <tv.raman.tv <at> gmail.com>

First off to diffuse the FUD, the daisy reader in emacspeak does
work, and I do use it regularly with books from Bookshare.

It's been a while since this was last posted to the list, so you
may want to give this a read:
http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
as a means of  increasing the chances of getting help.

Note that Bookshare recently changed some of its Daisy book
output, and some new books may not work --- code and patches
welcome --- that's the meaning of Open Source so we all dont
forget.

As for the outline-regexp problem, that's probably something in
your emacs setup you need to debug.

Current status of speech servers, and ideas wanted

Tyler Spivey <tspivey <at> pcdesk.net>
2010-03-12 21:33:07 GMT

I've been trying to get Emacspeak going again with an acceptable
level of performance for the past few days, without much luck.
Here's a summary of my findings on the current state of the various
speech servers that I have access to, and a request for ideas for
improving the situation:

espeak: The server is very unresponsive, and reads "capital" before
every uppercase word unless dtk-split-caps is off.
Sometimes, while moving quickly through a document, it will randomly
say various punctuation characters at the beginning of the line. I
think these are from the previous line.

software dectalk: I managed to get both 4.64 and 5.0 working, though
they did crash a few times in the few minutes I played with them.
They seem very responsive though, although software-dtk uses oss and
not alsa, and I don't think you can buy it anymore - the purchase
page just hangs.

outloud: the server can speak, but silencing speech doesn't work. I
don't know why.

Multispeech: I managed to get this to work after running sed -i
-e's/Russian-spelling/russian-spelling/' multispeech-voices.el.
Freephone/mbrola still workks, and espeak does too. I think an
interaction between portaudio and my alsa is causing it to drop the
last few ms of whatever it says, though.

Eflite: This works, including the alsa binary available at
http://homepage.hispeed.ch/loehrer/flite_alsa.html

Just a few comments.....

* There is considerable complexity in Linux sound architectures at this time -
  especially with distros now installing pulseaudio by default. 

* Many users are able to get the current servers working well. I currently
  have three different systems working with three different sound cards on
  three different linux  distributions

    i386 Debian Testing/unstable: SB Audigy 4 sound card, pulseaudio, alsa, 
    outloud, espeak, emacs23 and latest svn emacspeak.

    i386 Ubuntu Karmic: Intel HDA soundcard, pulseaudio, alsa, outloud,
    espeak, emacs23, svn emacspeak

    ia_64 Ubuntu Karmic: SB Audigy SE (CA0106) soundcard and Intel HDA
    soundcard, pulseaudio, alsa, espeak, emacs24, svn emacspeak. 

On all of these systems, I've created a system specific .asoundrc file. On the
Debian box, I've actually created a specific outloud pcm that points to one
channel, modified the outloud source to use that pcm rather than the default.
I did this because I found witht eh audigy 4 card, I couldn't get a dmix
config that worked well with outloud and didn't cause issues with other apps.
Essentially, this keeps them separate and prevents issues with alsa outloud
and pulseaudio. both outloud nd espeak work well on this system

On the i386 Ubuntu system, I have a .asoundrc file so that I can have outloud
and auditory icons (the HDA soundcard is not multi-channel capable). I do
still get contention with pulseaudio at times and haven't quite got that

One other point I forgot to mention. 

Withe espeak, tas you noted, unless you turn off the split caps mode, all
capital letters are preceeded with the word capital. What you may not have
realised is that espeak will still provide the split caps functionality
without split caps mode on. It seems this is just the default behavior for
espeak. So, turn off split capps mode globally and the annoying 'Capital'
before each capital letter is gone, but you still retain the useful split caps
behavior. 

Another annoying aspect of espeak I've not looked at yet is that it interprets
things like xl as roman numerals and will say 'roman 40' instead of xl. While
this may be fine for general text, its irritating for programming where you
might have a variable called xl. I've not looked at how this can be disabled.
It can be done on the command line for the espeak binary, but I'm not sure how
to do this from within the emacspeak driver. However, its not critical, just
annoying.

dtk-exp fixes for DECtalk USB

Zachary Kline <zkline <at> speedpost.net>
2010-03-21 20:36:09 GMT

Hi All,
I was interested in getting Emacspeak working with the DecTalk USB in
serial mode, which supposedly emulates an Express.  It initially gave
many errors and behaved poorly when the l{} function was used to do
character-at-a-time output.  I've modified the server so it gives fewer
errors in everyday use and l works properly.  I'm not quite sure about
the latter change: the way I did it might not be as precise as the original.
Anyhow, here's a patch.
Best,
Zack.
