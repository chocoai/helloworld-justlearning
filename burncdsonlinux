Burning CDs from the command line on any platform can be mysterious and vexing, and this is certainly true on Linux.
However, the commands and terminology are similar enough across platforms that it's useful to learn how to write CDs on
Linux. A lot of Linux software is distributed via .iso images, so if you know how to burn your own CDs, you can download
the .isos to create your own installation disks.

CD-writing programs are available for both Linux and Windows, but the Linux versions are more powerful and versatile
than their Windows cousins. In this article, we'll look at mkisofs and cdrecord, the workhorses of Linux CD recording.
mkisofs creates a pre-mastered image, to generate an ISO9660/JOLIET/HFS hybrid filesystem. It both creates and populates
a filesystem. Unlike other data storage media such as hard drives and floppy drives, a filesystem on CD is not first
created, then populated with data. There is only one chance with a CD-R: formatting it first would create a disk with an
empty filesystem. cdrecord records data on Orange Book CD-R/RWs, which is pretty much all of them.

With newfangled technology like CD recording, newer versions of these programs are best. mkisofs and cdrecord should
both be 1.10 or newer. The latest version of cdrecord, version 2.0, has been renamed cdrtools. To find the versions
installed on your machine, type:

$ cdrecord --version

and

$ mkisofs --version

For those who are new to the world of recordable CDs, here are a few things worth knowing before we press on:

  • CD-R: CD-Recordable. These are WORM (Write Once, Read Many).
  • CD-RW: CD-Rewritable. These are WMRM (Write Many, Read Many).
  • CD-Rs are universal and should be readable in any CD-ROM drive.
  • CD-RWs should be readable in all contemporary drives. A drive must be "multiread" to be able to read CD-R and CD-RW
    disks. Older drives are troublesome. Retire that old 4x drive and buy a new one; it's not worth the irritation.
  • Commercial CDs are pressed, not burned with a laser.
  • Which CD-R/RW drives are best? Visit the usual hardware reviewers for advice.

And, a few terms related to file formats:

  • Yellow Book: Physical format for data CDs
  • Orange Book: Physical format for recordable CDs:
      □ Part I: CD-MO (Magneto-Optical)
      □ Part II: CD-WO (Write-Once; includes "hybrid" spec for PhotoCD)
      □ Part III: CD-RW (Re-writable)
  • ISO-9660: The old file layout standard, allowing only 8.3 filenames
  • Rock Ridge: Extensions to ISO-9660 allowing long filenames and UNIX-style symlinks; preserves all file attributes,
    such as ownership and permissions. UNIX file attributes are not displayed when the disk is read on a Windows system.
  • Joliet: Microsoft extension to the ISO 9660 filesystem that allows Unicode characters to be used in filenames, as
    well as long filenames. It also creates truncated filenames for MS-DOS compatibility (these weird-looking things:
    FILENA~1.TXT). It allows filenames up to 64 characters, including spaces, and is readable by Windows 95 or later,
    and Macintosh computers running the Joliet Volume Access extension. Macs will not read Joliet file names longer than
    31 characters.
  • El Torito: Bootable CD-ROM format specification
  • HFS (Hierarchical File System): Native file system used by Macintosh
  • Multisession: Allows adding files over time, rather than during a single session. For a disk to be readable, the
    session must be "closed." However, this prevents adding more files to the disk. Multisession links the individual
    sessions and update the disk's table of contents so that it appears as a single directory.
  • CD-UDF (Universal Disk Format): Industry-standard incremental packet-writing filesystem

A brief word on UDF: UDF means being able to drop files directly onto the disk. Currently, this is done at the software
level. Reading the disk requires the software used to create it. UDF is in the works to be added to the Linux kernel,
probably 2.6. CD drives need CD-MRW circuitry ("CD Mount Rainier ReWrite"; don't ask me how they choose these names) for
this to work, so it will be a feature of new drives. When this is implemented, copying files to CD-R/RW will be as easy
as copying to a floppy disk, and the disks will be universally readable. This is touted as yet another replacement for
the venerable 3.5" diskette. We'll see. (See Resources for a link to more information on Mount Rainier.)

Linux SCSI emulation adventures

Use either an IDE/ATAPI or SCSI CD writer if you can. Parallel port interface is a horrid kluge asking for trouble, and
USB drives are slow. Neither is well-supported in Linux (although you might have better luck with the newer USB 2.0
drives).

IDE/ATAPI drives, which are the most common, need a bit of tweaking to work. So, what happens if cdrecord shows no
drives configured? To check, type this:

$ cdrecord -scanbus

If it displays your CD-RW drive (see Burning the disk, below), you can skip most of this section, although you might
want to skim through anyway for your own information.

Linux uses a SCSI emulation subsystem, so IDE/ATAPI CD-writers need compatibility drivers. If there is a CD-ROM and a
CD-R/RW on the same PC, both need to use the ide-scsi pseudo device driver to enable copying disks. There is no downside
to using the SCSI emulation on a CD-ROM; it will work just the same; only the name will change. Depending on your
particular flavor of Linux, the drive designation will change from something like /dev/cdrom0, or /dev/hdc, to /dev/scd0
(see Table 1 for a list of IDE/ATAPI device names).


Table 1. IDE/ATAPI device names
┌────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name   │ Device                                          │
├────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ hda    │ IDE bus/connector 0 master device               │
├────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ hdb    │ IDE bus/connector 0 slave device                │
├────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ hdc    │ IDE bus/connector 1 master device               │
├────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ hdd    │ IDE bus/connector 1 slave device                │
└────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

To find drives on your system, type:

$ dmesg | grep '^hd.:'

hda: IBM-DTLA-305020, ATA DISK drive
hdb: TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1202, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: LITE-ON LTR-24102B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hda: 40188960 sectors (20577 MB) w/380KiB Cache, CHS=2501/255/63, UDMA(66)

Most modern Linuxes come with the SCSI emulation already compiled into the kernel:

$ locate ide-scsi.o

/lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o

If your system does not have this, you'll have to compile it into your kernel. That is way too big a subject for this
wee article, so please see Resources (it's not hard, when you know how).

You'll need to edit two text files to configure the system to use the ide-scsi driver. The first is /etc/modules.conf
(in Debian, /etc/modules). My system has a CD-ROM and CD-R/RW drive, hdb and hdc. Add these lines to /etc/modules.conf
(or /etc/modules) using values appropriate for your system:

ide-cd ignore=\"hdb hdc\"
ide-scsi

By default, the IDE subsystem claims all ATA devices for its own, so the ignore line enables the SCSI subsystem to grab
both the CD-R/RW and CD-ROM.

Next, edit the configuration file for your bootloader, GRUB or LILO. For LILO users, add the following to the end of
lilo.conf:

append="hdb=ide-scsi"
append="hdc=ide-scsi"

For GRUB users, add the following to /etc/grub.conf (or in Debian, /boot/grub/menu.lst) at the end of the kernel line:

hdb=scsi hdc=scsi

Now reboot and verify that it has loaded:

$ lsmod

This will return a long list; look for ide-scsi.

Creating an .iso file

Once you've selected the files you want to copy, writing to a CD consists of two steps: creating an .iso with mkisofs,
then burning to disk with cdrecord. Use the following to create the .iso file:

$ mkisofs -o test.iso -Jrv -V test_disk /home/carla/

In this example:

  • -o names the new .iso image file (test.iso)
  • -J uses Joliet naming records, for Windows compatibility
  • -r uses Rock Ridge naming conventions for UNIX/Linux compatibility, and makes all files publicly readable
  • -v sets verbose mode, for a running commentary as the image is created
  • -V provides a volume ID (test_disk); this is the disk name that shows up in Windows Explorer
  • Last in the list are the files selected for packaging into the .iso (everything in /home/carla/)

Now, mount the .iso for verification; I like to create a test directory:

$ mkdir /test_iso
$ mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 test.iso /test_iso

Look at the directory contents; all your files should be there and readable. If they are not, the image is bad, and if
you burn it onto a disk, you'll end up creating a coaster.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Burning the disk

Writing the image to disk is easy as pie. First find the SCSI address of your CD-R/RW:

$ cdrecord -scanbus

Cdrecord 1.10 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2001 Jrg Schilling
Linux sg driver version: 3.1.24
Using libscg version 'schily-0.5'
scsibus0:
0,0,0 0) 'TOSHIBA ' 'DVD-ROM SD-M1202' '1020' Removable CD-ROM
0,1,0 1) 'LITE-ON ' 'LTR-24102B ' '5S54' Removable CD-ROM
0,2,0 2) *
0,3,0 3) *
0,4,0 4) *
0,5,0 5) *
0,6,0 6) *
0,7,0 7) *

The first three numbers for each item refer to SCSI bus, device ID, and LUN (Logical Unit Number), respectively. (The
fourth number is the device ID again.) cdrecord wants these three numbers. In this example, the CD recorder is 0,1,0.
Anything on SCSI bus 0 can be shortened to 1,0, leaving off the first 0. This is a common convention. Additional buses,
if any, must be specified -- no shortcuts.

Now write to disk:

$ cdrecord -v -eject speed=8 dev=0,1,0 test.iso

In this example:

  • -v is verbose
  • -eject ejects the disk when finished
  • -speed specifies write speed (8)
  • -dev is the device number (0,1,0) obtained from cdrecord -scanbus
  • Last is the name of the image being burned (test.iso)

This is a simple, serviceable way to create disks for public distribution, as it creates a disk that can be read on any
Windows or Linux system. mkisofs alone is good for creating .isos for download, and mkisofs is capable of creating
filesystems for many platforms. Please see mkisofs man pages for more information.

On a fast machine with lots of memory, you can get away with doing low-CPU-intensive tasks during recording, but it is
better to do nothing else during a burn. The laser is not capable of stopping and then picking up where it left off, so
any interruptions are fatal.

cdrecord will try to run the recorder at its highest speed, so it is not necessary to specify a speed, but let
experience be your guide. Specifying slower speeds is useful for correcting errors and buffer underruns. Newer drives
with "burn-proof" technology (the opposite of what it's supposed to do; again, who comes up with these names?) are not
plagued by buffer underruns as older drives are.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Copy disk

To directly copy from the source disk to the recordable disk, use this command:

$ cdrecord -v dev=0,1,0 speed=4 -isosize /dev/scd0

This command directly streams the contents of the CD-ROM, /dev/scd0, to the CD recorder, dev=0,1,0. Don't do this on an
old, slow machine. Direct copying is fast, but more error-prone. It is better to first copy the source disk to a hard
drive, then copy from the hard drive to the CD recorder:

$ mount /cdrom
$ dd if=/dev/scd0 of=/tmp/diskfile.iso
$ cdrecord dev=0,1,0 speed=8 fs=8m -v -eject -dummy /tmp/diskfile.iso

Notice a couple of new options, fs=8m and -dummy. fs=8m defines the size of the ring buffer: the bigger the better, up
to a point. Remember, interruptions are fatal; fs=8m creates a large enough buffer to keep the recorder working if
something slows down the data transfer. If 8 MB isn't enough, you might need a better PC. On the other hand, more than 8
MB is not necessarily better, as the operating system can waste time reloading the MMU (Memory Management Unit) tables.
The default is 4 MB.

-dummy is a marvelous option for doing a dry run before risking an actual disk. The recorder does everything with the
laser turned off, giving the user a chance to catch errors before committing them to disk.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Multisession

CDs are built with sessions, and sessions are divided into tracks. On a single-session disk, there is a lead-in, a
single TOC (table of contents), the data, and a lead-out, which finalizes the disk and prevents further recording on the
disk. mkisofs links the separate sessions together. Creating multisession disks may be easier with GUI programs like
X-CD-Roast or KonCD, but here's how command-line commandos do it.

The first time you record a session on a disk, use the -multi switch in cdrecord:

$ cdrecord -v -eject speed=8 dev=0,1,0 -multi test.iso

The disk will be fixated in a manner that makes it readable and open for adding more data. To add more sessions to this
disk, mkisofs needs to know the starting and ending sector numbers, which you can find like this:

$ cdrecord dev=0,1,0 -msinfo
0,27139

Be sure to have the disk you are adding data to in the CD recorder. Then add two new switches, -C and -M:

$ mkisofs -o test2.iso -Jr -V Session2 -C 0,27139 -M 0,1,0 /files/path/

Or better, let the command shell do the work:

$ mkisofs -o test2.iso -Jr -V Session2 -C `cdrecord dev=0,1,0 -msinfo` -M 0,1,0 /files/path/

Multisession CD drives read the last session written. This command takes the TOC from the last session and combines it
into the new TOC. For the last session on the disk, omit the -multi option.

Conclusion

CD writing in Linux is powerful and versatile. CD recorders can be shared over networks and used in automated backups;
mkisofs and cdrecord also work with DVDs. Although there are many good graphical front ends, complete functionality is
at the command line.
