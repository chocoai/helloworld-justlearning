I.--UPDATES
____________________


    Version 2.7 - July 24th, 2003 - Another fairly routine update. Lots
                of new references, and finally added the three new
                quotes Illidan has in TFT. Wouldn't have noticed them if
                it weren't for El Sabotender and EndlessInfinity.

                Anyway, a brief edition of You're a Moron, standard e-mail
                updates, corrections, and we're good to go.

                Also, since I've had a lot of people ask me about why
                some lines are not included in the FAQ, I figured I'd
                define what a "Pissed Quote" is. This is a quote spouted
                by the unit only after it has been clicked upon multiple
                times in succession. In other words, under normal play,
                you'd only hear attack confirmation quotes or those said
                when the unit is finished training. And since you're likely
                to hear any of these lines during a standard game, I only
                list the Pissed Quotes, which you'd otherwise have to go
                out of your way to hear.

                Eventually, within a few months when the FAQ just has
                nothing more to be added to it, I might go about and
                added the notable confirmation/creation lines. But until
                then, please don't e-mail me about them.

                Expect the next update within the next two weeks.


    Version 2.6 - July 15th, 2003 - Well, I said I'd update next when they
                gave the Sea Witch a soundset... but then when I finally
                picked up TFT, I noticed that she didn't have one still.
                In any case, fully updated the guide with the Pissed Quotes
                of all the Campaign Heroes and units. Also, for easier
                reference to those who've just come across the guide,
                since it should be in the TFT section soon, I've inserted
                a marker next to all units, heroes, and characters new
                to the expansion. To find these fastest, use Find (Ctrl+F)
                to look for *NEW TFT* . This was even added to all quote
                sets added to this guide during the Beta. Most notable would
             be the new section given to the Naga race. Did I miss
	anything? Please, feel free to tell me.

                Special thanks to Arrlaari who went through the effort of
                sending me a fairly lengthy list of quotes from TFT units,
                but I had already prepared this FAQ with my own research
                by the time I had checked his e-mail. Sorry, but thanks.

                Went through the usual e-mail updates and I'm preparing for
                another huge hit when this FAQ is added to the TFT section.
                Top 10 FAQs List = Headache.

                Next matter of importance: My inferiority.org e-mail has
                been down for a while now. But it was only a forwarder in
                any case. Send any e-mail to me at linoleummunki@hotmail.com
                from now on.

                And finally, inaugurating a new section finally to the guide.
                After arguing over the title for sometime, I've decided to
                settle for "You're a Moron". You'll find it in as the
                first part of the third section of the guide, Contact, Etc.
                After having to deal with the occasional raging idiot for
                the last year with this guide, I figured it was finally
                time to vent a little rage. I'll keep this updated with
                every new version, unless I just can't find anyone
                stupid enough to bash. And trust me, I'm hoping I can't.

                In any case, next update will probably becoming within a week
                or two, or else I'm going to fall behind like crazy and let
                my Hotmail box get filled up again...



    Version 2.5 - April 17th, 2003 - With the 308 build of Beta comes
                another update. Didn't even think to check for anything
                new this patch until I noticed "new media for some units"
                listed among the changes on the Blizz forums. And from
                what I've gathered this far, they've redone the Faerie
                Dragon and Pit Lords sound sets and added a set for
                the Beastmaster.

		So, aside from the addition of the Beastie and Pit Lord
                qutoes (Nope, Faerie Dragons still only shriek), added
                some more sources, notably for the Spirit Walker, which
                I forgot to add in before sending in the last version
                of the FAQ. So sorry to those of you who sent in credits
                for them, but I already had them. You'll still be
                added to the thanks list at the bottom.

		And that's that, for now at least. If you happen to
                notice any other units aside from the three listed above
                whom have had their sound sets updated as of 308, please
                inform me of it. Expect the next update by the next
                major patch, as that seems to be the next time any media
                updates will come.


    Version 2.4 - April 8th, 2003 - Back once more for a fairly large
                update. Tons of new Beta references this time around.
                And, by the way, yes, the Orc's Tauren Spirit Walker now
                has his own sound set, and it's certainly worth checking
                out. Blizzard keeps up its high standards of actually
                making me laugh at fart jokes. The new Neutral Hero,
                the Naga Sea Witch, lacks a sound set as of yet, but I'll
                obviously update once she gets one.

		Also of note this time around is that I was recently
                contacted by a person far more credible than anyone else
                when it comes to the pissed unit quotes. I'll leave this
                person's identity anonymous, as they requested, but I will
                be using the nickname "Deepthroat" for them when it comes
                to creditting source additions or quote corrections. And
                no, don't bother e-mailing me asking for this person's
                identity, as I wish to respect their wishes.

                Next update? Probably when the Sea Witch gets her sound
                set. Until then, I'm going to make a more direct attempt
                at getting this guide listed under the Frozen Throne
                FAQ section.


    Version 2.3 - March 10th, 2003 - Standard updates, for the most part.
                Immediately after uploading the last version, I noticed
                my most obvious fallacy; calling Spellbreakers Spell
                Stealers. I felt rather idiotic for that, but c'est la vie.
                Anyway, the update worth noting is the addition of the
                Pandaren Brewmaster's pissed quotes, in the neutral
                heroes section. He's not yet available normally as of
                this FAQ being written, but he can be used in a few
                custom maps, including an FT Hero Arena.

                As always, if you sent something in and you do not
                notice your name listed as the credit for the source,
                then someone likely beat you to the punch, and your name
                is instead listed in the Group Thanks at the bottom of
                the FAQ. Next update will likely come within 2 weeks. See
                you guys then.

    Version 2.2 - March 5th, 2003 - Guess who got the beta? Obviously,
                Blizzard has recognized me as the only person on the 'net
                willing to waste hours of his life to transcribe the
                pissed off quotes of their units, and have rewarded me
                justly. No sir, had nothing to do with blind, dumb,
                incredibly random lucky. Not at all. In celebration
                of this event, it's time to update this guide. First up,
                I had a handful of large e-mail updates to add to the
                guide. A lot more clarification, and a few mysteries
                finally solved. Secondly, I've added all of the Frozen
                Throne units currently available in the beta to their
                proper sections. This covers the following:

                Neutral - Dark Ranger
                Human - Blood Mage, Dragon Hawk, Spell Stealer
                Night Elf - Warden
                Orc - Shadow Hunter, Batrider
                Undead - Crypt Lord

                Obviously, this is not every unit available in the beta.
                However, as of yet, the Orc's Spirit Walker has the same
                pissed sound bite set as the standard Tauren, and also
                the Obsidian Statue, Black Sphinx, Faerie Dragon, and
                Mountain Giant only make noises. The Dragon, I should
                note, sounds much akin to a pair of Zerglings hatching.
                Only several thousand times more shrill. Quite the
                nuisance. If I've made any mistakes with the FT quotes,
                please drop me a line, since I jotted down many of the
                shorter quotes after only one listening.

                Anyway, that's that. See you guys next time.


    Version 2.1 - February 23rd, 2003 - Haha, alright alright, an update.
                I had one prepared in October actually, after going
                through nearly 500 pieces of mail, which was then lost
                when my rebellious computer decided to freeze. After that,
                I was somewhat discouraged from updating again, despite
                my Hotmail box (to which all my inferiority.org mail gets
                sent) being completely backed up. However, in an effort
                to finish what I've started, I'm picking this FAQ back
                up again. However, as implied previously, my Hotmail
                box, for the most part, has flushed out most of my
                mail, and I accidentally wiped out the entire first page
                of my box the other day, which has resulted in utter chaos.

                Anyway, this update isn't so much an ACTUAL update. Aside
                from a few outstanding typographical errors made, there is
                no new content here. However, if you've been dissuaded from
                e-mailing me due to the lack of updates, let this
                basically be the notice to start sending mail again.
                However, I've something I intended to say a while ago,
                when I actually had the multi-hour update prepared.
                Many people have gone to great lengths to try and attain
                sources for some of these quotes which are, to say the
                least, rather silly. Trying to credit an old saying to
                an Austin Powers movie, for example, is not advised.
                Use your brain and better judgment when sending something
                in.

                Again, I apologize for the ridiculous delay, and sincerely
                wish to restart this once more, and try to make this FAQ
                as complete as possible before the expansion pack is
                released. -Munki


    Version 2.0 - July 10th, 2002 - Damn, in one day I get about twice as
                much mail as I'd get in a month for my old FAQ. Anyway,
                I should point out that a) I'm not a Star Wars fan,
                and b) I usually overlooked very obvious ones, so I missed
                out on a large load of those references. Secondly,
                I checked my mail starting with the oldest letter,
                so I simply credited the first person with their addition,
                and anyone who reported the same thing later was added to
                the Thanks list. Oh, and in the future, try to give me
                your GameFAQs alias, if any, to credit you with, for
                simplicity's sake. Sorry for not responding to the
                great bulk of the letters, but I wanted to try and get
                this updated as swiftly as possible. Next update, I'll
                probably add other various unit quotes (ie. not quotes
                activated by multiple clicking) along with the standard
                additions. -Munki

    Version 1.0 - July 8th, 2002 - First version obviously enough.
                Finished the entire FAQ up in about three hours time.
                There'll still be a bit of work ahead, but this is
                really more of a one or two update FAQ anyway.
                Now back to wasting time on B-Net -MunkiBleedsGreen



II.--FOREWORD
____________________


    The best way to enjoy Warcraft 3 is to click EVERYTHING many many
  times. Warcraft vets should be used to the units yelling back at
  their infernal masters in the skies, but WC3 really takes the
  concept to the next level. More phrases, more humour, lots of insanity.
  And so, since I was quite bored this morning, I've decided to compile
  every "Pissed" quote every intelligible unit says. In other words,
  the units that just growl were ignored.

    So, read away, but remember that many of them are infinitely more
  entertaining when being spoken by the units. The easiest way to get
  access to the sound files is through World Edit, by the way.

    I've also provided, just to show off my massive amount of useless
  knowledge, whatever sources some lines may be lifted from, like
  a movie or some such. There's a few quotes that are partially
  unintelligible though, so if you want to help out, wherever you see
  a <?> throughout the FAQ, try deciphering that line. I haven't
  placed a few of the sources for quotes either, so if you know any,
  feel free to report that too. E-mail me at munki@inferiority.org.
  I'll be sure to credit you in the Collection.

    Lastly, a source marked with ~ is an exact quote, while > is either
  a reference to the source or a modified quote, and ones marked with ?
  have unknown sources, if any source at all. Why did I bother with
  this? Because there's nothing good on TV.

    Without further ado, darkness calls. Over and over again. He
  abuses speed dial apparently.

  *NEW TFT* Blood Elf Peasant

  ?-Why is this in the Creep section?
   Because Neutral doesn't sound right and it's sound files are found in the
   Creep folder. Happy?

	-"Look, I'm an Engineer. My time is valuable."

	-"Why don't you bother someone else with your incessant clicking?"

	-"If it's really THAT urgent, why don't you do it yourself?.'

	-"It's simple. Just take the hydraulic phase shift emulator and
        attach it to the trans-dimensional photon emitter. Bam, new tower."

  *NEW TFT* Draenei

  ?-Why is this in the Creep section?
   Because I thought that "Campaign Units" would be a stupid section
   for the Scourge to have. Also, they CAN be found as creeps...

  >Correct me if I'm wrong, but all Draenei units share these quotes.

       ~Other: Da Dinictus decides to clarify this for the uninformed.
       Simply put, Pandas have been documented to be terribly reluctant to
       mate when not in the wild (and not even terribly inclined to do so
       IN the wild). Scientists refuse to give up on the asexual teddy
       bears though, and have gone as far as showing the pandas videos of
       other pandas humping to try and give the would-be couples an idea.
       Not much success with that, surprisingly.

	-"If you don't master your anger, your anger will master you.
        I should know."
         ~Movie: Kulsakidis and Matt Bruce almost simultaneously point out
         that this is a possible reference to the (in my opinion) god awful
         Ben Stiller movie "Mystery Men". Wes Studi's character repeats
         a similar line to Stiller's.

	-Blood Mage: "Hi, my name is Roy. I'm a Magic-Addict."
        -Magic-Addicts Anonymous Crowd: "Hi Roy."

	-"My blood cries out for the vengeance of my people's blood, which
        can only be repaid with twice as much blood! Or maybe three times

        and that blood was on fire, and it was raining blood, then maybe
        THAT would be enough blood. But, uh... probably not."

       convincing me that Michael Gabriel does not exist and that
       I'm clearly an idiot ^^

	-"Touch me naught! I am chaste."
       ~Movie: This one was apparently grazed over by most for a while,
       however, Plynch117@aol.com notes that this is a line uttered by
       Sir Gallahad when he enters the lusty maiden's chapel, a scene from
       the commonly quoted 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.

	-"No? Is that your final answer?"
	 ~TV: Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, obviously.

	-"I have bad brethren."
       ->Thanks to HappyHamster for a spellcheck.

	-"Is that a sword? LUXURY! Is that a horse? SLOTH! Is that a

       >TV: UnSub credits this to a 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' skit,
       with the crew as coal miners complaining about how having a house
       (and other necessities, etc.) was LUXURY since in their day, they
       lived in cardboard boxes. I remember seeing the very same skit but
       neither of us are sure on this one.
       ->Brian Kern validates our assumption, and credits the reference
       to a skit entitled "The Four Yorkshiremen".

    pissed quotes with the Wind Serpent from the original, but the voice
    is completely different.

	-"I'll hit the brakes, and he'll fly right by."

       Homer Simpsons trademark interjection, from the animated TV series,

       Clapton. Thanks to thehilander@hotmail.com and Negs for those
       though.

	 *Best. Quote. EVER.*
       ->Amanda pointed out a 'Fifth Element' connection, as Gary Oldman's
       character gets called by one Mr. Darkness, but I think it's just

  Far Seer

	-"I see dead people"
	 ~Movie: 'The Sixth Sense'. Also an in-game cheat code.

	-"Touch your tongue to mine."
	 ~Other: Reference to 'Thumb Wars', a Star Wars parody. Stephen Hall
       gave me the heads up on this one first.
       ->Dakres3@aol.com lists this as a reference to a scene from
       'Cruel Intentions' with Sarah Michelle Gellar teaching another girl
       how to kiss. Which only makes the Far Seer saying it, followed by
       the wolf's whimper, far more interesting.
       ->Let's let Brian Kern field this one.

	"In Cruel Intentions, the closest that they get is this line: `Let's
         try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your
         mouth. When I do I want you to massage my tongue with yours."
         --http://www.geocities.com/annete_hargrove/script.htm

         The clever movie watcher will note that Cruel Intentions was
         released in 1999, March 5th, while Thumb Wars was released on
         November 2nd, 1999 at the Tokyo Film Festival. It was then
         pushed to DVD in 2001.

         Given that Thumb Wars is a parody of Star Wars and other films,
         it's quite likely they're parodying Cruel Intentions with `Touch
         your tongue to mine'. But the line itself is in fact from
         Thumb Wars.

         A quote of a parody of a remake of a good movie."

       but I couldn't manage to find the script online to double check.
       Sounds fairly likely though. I'm just curious as to why they chose
       a rasta witch doctor to emulate Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes from

		"The final annoyed quote of the Orc Spirit Walker is a

                inserting fart sounds into his sermons at the most

       *Not a pissed quote, but his kamikaze quote. Worth noting anyway.

	>Other: This, and every other quote of Kel'Thuzad's is a tongue
        in cheek reference to the pseudo-religion Scientology, referenced
        again in this guide later. Alex Quayle, though, specifically links
        this line to a quote of the "religion"'s founder, L. Ron Hubbard,
        former trashy sci-fi novelist turned Jesus.

          "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants
          to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own
      religion."

	-"Sorry, I don't do interviews."

	-"We're not a cult, so much as a maniacal group of  fanatical,
        blade-wielding zealots."
       >Other: While also another jab at Scientology, the "blade wielding

       Mel Brooks' "History of the World, Part 1".

	-"Humans check-in. They don't check-out."
       >Other: A reference to common catchphrase for bug traps, such as
       roach motels. Of course, Crypt Lord is in fact a giant beetle, so
       I suppose this is a bit out of left field. And come to think of
       it, why is the lord of the Nerubian spider race a beetle anyway?
       El Sabotender points this one out first.
       ~Movie: Kenneth Chu credits this to one of the closing scenes in
       'Men in Black', and until I have a chance to check, I'll take his
       word for it.

	-"And they say Blizzard games don't have bugs!"

	-*in an english accent, uncommon for a monstrous insect*
	-"I'm the fifth Beatle."

  Death Knight

	-"Has hell frozen over yet?"
	>Other: Logan likens this to a pun from the "Preacher" comic series.
        written by Garth Ennis, comparing it to the "Saint of Killers",
        whose arrival litteraly freezes hell over. It's a bit of a stretch
        but he gets points for bizzare effort.
        >Other: Apparent Master of the Obvious, Optimus Prime, goes the low
        road and makes the obvious connection of it being a play on the
        spiteful reply of "When hell freezes over." Normally, I wouldn't
        list it, but I just wanted to deduct points for lack of originality.

	-"I am the One Horseman of the Apocalypse."

       commercials.

	-"This is not a dress, it's the standard Dreadlord uniform."
       ->Rich Burr passes along a bit of info about this one. The original
       Dreadlord character image, from Alpha, was basically wearing a "gown"
       similar to the one the Lich wears. The quote makes little sense
       accompanying the current image, but is more suited to the old. And
       for the curious, you can spot the old Dreadlord in this image

       >Music: After outright refusing to list any of the many deranged
       or completely idiotic credits sent in by some people, Mattias
       Sossna finally sends in something listing. 'Dressed to Kill'
       is an album from the band KISS, which is good enough of a

       any of the claims previously made about the Jackie Chan cartoon.

       And I'll have to agree with this above all, since I do recall
       those pompous commercials.

       sitemaster@conversawang.com and Jason noted the connection between
       the Cult of the Damned and Scientology, so I'm further compelled to
       believe it. By the way, I have a semi-lengthy little hate rant about
       Scientology on my site <plug>www.inferiority.org</plug>, as well.
       Now, just for completist sakes...

	 >According to optimus137@hotmail.com
	 "There is a Simpsons book in which on the first page it says to
        find the secret to the meaning of life turn to page so and so and
        it says on that page to go to another one eventually you go back
        to the page you started on and don't find out any secret."

       >And next, Matt Hylan credits this to 'Bart Simpson's Guide To Life:
       A Wee Handbook for the Perplexed', which may be the title of the
       book optimus referred to. To this one's still up in the air.

       ->And lastly, asmor@attbi.com wasn't sure of this and ran a search

       originally in 1931, in a basic form, by Louis Armstrong. Louis Prima
       would later adapt the song and take it in as his own in 1954. Unless
       you believe Prima's former band member, Sam Butera, who claims that
       he was the songwriter. So take that all as you will.

I.--YOU'RE A MORON
____________________

 7/24/03

  The second entrant into these illustrious halls is...

	Jason Malashevich <jasons073@yahoo.com>

  Admiral Genius brings this to us...

	"The quote from the death knight, "I am the One Horseman of the
        Apocalypse." actually has to do with the Marvel X-men comic
        series.  The Apocalypse had four mutants called "horsemen" who
        were his chief liutennants."

  Okay, so I'm not religious. However, if you're tracing the lineage of
  "The Four Horseman" to Marvel Comics and not, say, the Bible, you should
  probably re-think sending me any e-mail. Of course, as we all know,
  'The Bible' was printed only months before the first Apocalypse story
  arc in the X-Men, so I can see how he'd get confused.



 7/15/03

  And the first inductee to the You're a Moron hall is none other than...

	"The Night Falcon" <killer_mew@hotmail.com>

  And our new hero drops me this delicious bite of insightful information.

       "According to your FAQ, the Lich hero said this:

	-"You should see the skeletons in my closet."

	Since you have posted info on where phrases come from, I just want to 	tell
you that the phrase was taken from Eminem's song: Cleaning out 	        my
Closet.

	Here's an extract of the song:

	I got some skeletons in my closet
	And I don't know if no one knows it

	Just letting you know."

  Well thank God for that. Never had I known that Marshall Maters infact
  invented a phrase dating back to tales hundreds of years old now. Truly,
  Eminem is a timeless artist. This is the basic equivalent of acrediting
  for the invention of inhaling oxygen. He's using a cliched phrase, he's
  not weaving a poetic wane for the eons.

  And as a special "stfu", the album on which the song appears was released
  just days before WC3 was. Good to see the Blizzard sound crew burning the
  midnight oil, slaving into the wee hours of night, and halting the
  production presses just to make sure that Eminem gets his "mad propz, yo".

  Look guys, all I need here in this guide is some well thought out
  references. If a quote seems FAR too obvious as a play or reference
  to a TERRIBLY well known, common phrase, don't bother. You're either going
  to just bother me with trivial obviousness, or make yourself out to look
  like a jackass, like our friend here. Unless the play is TERRIBLY clever,
  you should usually stick to referencing some types of media, like
  television, movies, music, literate, or even world events. Thanks a lot.

  And Night Falcon, congratulations. You're a Moron.
