The long and the short of it

Verb conjugation and contraction - in other words; "The short form".

In spoken English we use the short form a lot. We say things like: I'm / you're / didn't etc. instead
of I am / you are / did not etc.

We also use these short forms in informal written English. When we write in the short form, we use an
apostrophe (') for the missing letter(s).

The imperative

Let Us

Let us is a funny one. The only time I've ever heard the long form of "Let us..." used is when the
vicar used to say "Let us pray." It's much more likely you'll hear or see the contracted form "let's".
"Let's do this," no "Let's do that instead," and the sarcastic "Oh yes, let's."
